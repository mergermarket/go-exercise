Exercise 3: Internet Café

A small internet café in a village just outside of Manilla has 8 computers, which are available on a first-come first-serve basis. When all the computers are taken, the next person in line has to wait until a computer frees up.

This morning several groups of tourists, 25 people in all, are waiting when the doors open.

Each person spends between 15 minutes and 2 hours online.

Write a program to simulate the computer usage at the café
